there will be 2 parts in promises 
.production code
.consuming code


let data = 1;

console.warn(data)
data = 2;

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(data);
}, 3000); 

// set timeout gives out put after given time


 data = 3;
 console.log(data)
// gives out put as 1,3,3 as settimeout also takes 3 as
// to resolve that we use promises



 promises is the solution for callback functions
 cycle is 
 > promise is made
 >1st stage is pending stage
 > next 2 stages either resolve or reject
 >>resolve uses .then .i.e. promise chaining
 >>reject uses .catch i.e. error handling
 lest see with the example
